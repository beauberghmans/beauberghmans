## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Beau Berghmans!
Currently working as a **Generic ICT Consultant** at **Randstad Digital**, with my current project being at **Brussels Airport Company** where I am providing Operational ICT Support.
Brussels Airport Company is the **second largest** economic motor of Belgium, bringing it own set of challenges.
